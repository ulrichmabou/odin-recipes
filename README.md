# odin-recipes


This is the [first project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) of TOP Foundations course. The goal is to build a simple recipe website using **HTML only.** The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

The project will help to practice using a few of the HTML elements covered in the **HTML Foundations** part of the course, namely:

* Text elements
* Lists
* Links and images
